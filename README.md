### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a computer science graduate student at UC Davis. With 5 years of experience in [V-capital](ma.v-capital.cn/en/) (a venture capital specializing in tech investments), I've gained valuable insights into business and technology, as well as excellent communication and coordination skills. My desire to be directly involved in tech development has motivated me to transition into the tech industry. I'm immersed in my tech journey, continually exploring diverse facets of the IT landscape.

Please find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/hezhixie/) for a more detailed description of my experience, education and skills. You can get in touch with me by email at [hezxie@ucdavis.edu](hezxie@ucdavis.edu).
